match_td()
	- add more tests for continuous / date input
	- add propensity score matching type methods
	- finish documentation
	- merge documentation of match_td() and match_td.fit()
	- maybe change output?
		- maybe remove the functionality related to censoring / events
		- put that into a different function called something like matchtd_data()
		- output a "MatchTD" object (or similar stuff) with print(), summary() method
	- allow support for "cobalt" package

merge_td()
	- allow multiple event variables in event_times (probably best to allow a list of data.tables)

long2start_stop()
	- allow event variables to be specified

New features:
	- add_td(): general function to add variables to time-to-event data
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights
	- clean up and export add_tte_outcome() function (possible rename / re-factor)

General TODOs:
	- finish vignette on start-stop data generation
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_td()
	- add README
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website
		- sticker
		- ...
		
Simulation:
	- will currently fail because match_td() now uses overlapping intervals (among other changes)
