match_td()
	- add more tests for continuous / date input
	- add tests to check if it works with internally used variable names
	- add propensity score matching type methods
	- finish documentation
	- merge documentation of match_td() and match_td.fit()
	- maybe change output?
	- allow support for "cobalt" package
	- add "start" and "stop" argument for consistency
	
merge_td()
	- tests / input checks for empty data.table input

subset_start_stop()
	- allow vector input to "first_time" and "last_time" + support for NA
	- then delete remove_after_treat() and remove_before_treat() functions, replace them by this one

New features:
	- long2start_stop(): migrate this function from simDAG to here
	- wide2start_stop(): transform a wide-format dataset into the start-stop format
	- start_stop2long(): transform a start-stop format dataset into the long format
	- start_stop2wide(): transform a start-stop format dataset into the wide format
	- add_td(): general function to add variables to time-to-event data
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights

General TODOs:
	- add vignette on start-stop data generation
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_td()
	- add README
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website
		- sticker
		- ...
		
Simulation:
	- will currently fail because match_td() now uses overlapping intervals
