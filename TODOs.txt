match_time() methods
	- allow user-supplied models in methods "psm", "pgm", "dsm"
	- support things other than the cox model internally when using methods "psm", "pgm", "dsm"
	- maybe allow competing risks models in methods "pgm" and "dsm"
	- in method="pgm" / "dsm": allow fit of risk score model to be made on either all units or only on
	  untreated units as described in He (2020)
	- method="psm" / "pgm" / "dsm" fail when strata() is used in formula of cox model

match_time() general
	- currently, when using matchit(), cases are discarded if no match is found,
	  which is not what happens in match_method="none" or match_method="fast_exact"
	  this should be consistent, not sure which option is better
	- maybe add a debug more or something similar to better understand when an error occured
	- catch warnings in matchit() or fast_exact_matching() and output better warning instead
	- "d_longest" is calculated by ignoring inclusion criteria, an option to change this might be useful
	- input checks
		- should check whether there is only one treatment per person
		- should check if it "stays" there
		- checks for empty input / empty after inclusion criteria

merge_start_stop()
	- allow multiple event variables in event_times (probably best to allow a list of data.tables)
	- do competing risks work with "event_times" argument?

long2start_stop()
	- allow event variables to be specified

add_outcome()
	- maybe allow different types of outcomes (event counts, binary etc.)

New features:
	- add_covariate(): similar to add_outcome() but for covariates of different types
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights
	- implement clone-censor-re-weighting approach
	- implement various analysis functions
	- implement plot_flowchart(), taking a match_time object to generate classic flow charts

General TODOs:
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_time()
	- in this vignette (or another vignette) give a table with supported funtionality
		- what treatments are allowed (timings, binary vs. categorical, ...)?
		- what outcomes are allowed per method (recurrent, competing events, ...)?
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website (divide functions into groups here)
		- sticker
		- ...

Theoretical:
	- what would other estimands look like?
	- categorical treatments?
	- what about treatments that do not stay at "treated" value once there?

Simulation:
	- will currently fail because a lot has changed in match_time() and related functions
