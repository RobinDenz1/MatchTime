match_td()
	- add more tests for continuous / date input
	- add tests to check if it works with internally used variable names
	- add propensity score matching type methods
	- finish documentation
	- merge documentation of match_td() and match_td.fit()
	- maybe change output?
	- allow support for "cobalt" package
	- add "start" and "stop" argument for consistency

fast_exact_matching()
	- rename to fast_exact_matching.fit()
	- write new function called fast_exact_matching() that just calls the .fit() version
	  but has a formula interface

New features:
	- long2start_stop(): migrate this function from simDAG to here
	- wide2start_stop(): transform a wide-format dataset into the start-stop format
	- start_stop2long(): transform a start-stop format dataset into the long format
	- start_stop2wide(): transform a start-stop format dataset into the wide format
	- add_td(): general function to add variables to time-to-event data
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights

General TODOs:
	- add vignette on start-stop data generation
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_td()
	- add README
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website
		- sticker
		- ...
		
Simulation:
	- will currently fail because match_td() now uses overlapping intervals (among other changes)
