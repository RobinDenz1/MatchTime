match_td() features
	- add more tests for continuous / date input
	- add propensity score matching type methods
	- finish documentation

merge_start_stop()
	- allow multiple event variables in event_times (probably best to allow a list of data.tables)

long2start_stop()
	- allow event variables to be specified

add_outcome()
	- maybe allow different types of outcomes (event counts, binary etc.)
	- add examples to documentation (needs to be added elsewhere as well)

New features:
	- add_covariate(): similar to add_outcome() but for covariates of different types
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights

General TODOs:
	- add input check whether columns start with . everywhere
	- finish vignette on start-stop data generation
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_td()
	- add README
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website
		- sticker
		- ...
		
Simulation:
	- will currently fail because a lot has changed in match_td() and related functions
