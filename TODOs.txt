match_time() methods
	- add "all" method which would simply include all eligible controls at t
	- add tests for new methods

match_time() general
	- currently, when using matchit(), cases are discarded if no match is found,
	  which is not what happens in match_method="none" or match_method="fast_exact"
	  this should be consistent, not sure which option is better
	- maybe add a debug more or something similar to better understand when an error occured

merge_start_stop()
	- allow multiple event variables in event_times (probably best to allow a list of data.tables)

long2start_stop()
	- allow event variables to be specified

add_outcome()
	- maybe allow different types of outcomes (event counts, binary etc.)

New features:
	- add_covariate(): similar to add_outcome() but for covariates of different types
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights

General TODOs:
	- finish vignette on start-stop data generation
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_time()
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website
		- sticker
		- ...

Theoretical:
	- what would other estimands look like?

Simulation:
	- will currently fail because a lot has changed in match_time() and related functions
