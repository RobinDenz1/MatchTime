match_time()
	- add propensity score matching type methods
	- allow function input to "match_method"
	- fix bug with replace_at_t=TRUE & using matchit()
	- fix estimand implementation (currently ignored in match_time())
	- add tests for estimand

fast_exact_matching()
	- if "replace" is used, it should never take the same id as controls > 1 times per case

merge_start_stop()
	- allow multiple event variables in event_times (probably best to allow a list of data.tables)

long2start_stop()
	- allow event variables to be specified

add_outcome()
	- maybe allow different types of outcomes (event counts, binary etc.)

add_previous_event_count()
	- fix column order to be the same as before (remove ignore.col.order argument in tests afterwards)

New features:
	- add_covariate(): similar to add_outcome() but for covariates of different types
	- estimate_ipcw(): function to estimate inverse probability of censoring weights

General TODOs:
	- finish vignette on start-stop data generation
	- add vignette showcasing time-dependent matching with match_time()
	- add usual package stuff
		- pkgdown website
		- sticker
		- ...
		
Simulation:
	- will currently fail because a lot has changed in match_time() and related functions
