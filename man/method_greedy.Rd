\title{
Time-Dependent Greedy Selection of Controls
}
\description{
This documentation page describes the matching process used when setting \code{method="greedy"} in the \code{\link{match_time}} function and gives a explanation on which arguments may still be used in this case. No additional arguments are currently supported when using this method.
}
\details{
Due to the nature of this approach, almost none of the arguments of the \code{\link{match_time}} function may be used when using \code{method="greedy"}, because they do not make sense in the context of greedy selection of controls. More specifically, only the arguments \code{formula}, \code{data}, \code{id}, \code{inclusion}, \code{start}, \code{stop}, \code{method} and \code{verbose} can be used with this method.

\strong{\emph{How it works}}:

All other methods implemented in this package use some sort of matching to select a pre-specified number of controls from the pool of available data. When using \code{method="greedy"}, this is not the case. Instead of performing a selection, every single individual that is eligible to be a control at the point in time at which "matching" occurs is selected as control. For example, suppose that at \eqn{t = 10} there are 100 individuals in the dataset. Of these individuals, 20 receive the treatment for the first time at \eqn{t} and 10 already have received the treatment before \eqn{t}. The remaining 70 individuals are all eligible to be sampled as controls at this point in time (if they fufill the \code{inclusion} criteria) and are thus all used as controls.

This process is repeated at each point in time at which at least one individual switches from the control to the treated condition. The selection of controls proceeds as if \code{replace_at_t=TRUE}, regardless of the value supplied to the argument. Replacement of controls over time is neccessary, because otherwise there woule be no controls left after the first time at which an individual receives treatment.

This method might seem odd at first, but as Gran et al. (2010) have shown, it does work quite well for some estimands of interest if the analysis is done in an appropriate manner. These authors propose censoring the controls whenever they later receive treatment (as implemented in the argument \code{censor_at_treat} of the \code{\link{add_outcome}} function) and using sequential Cox models to perform the actual confounder adjustment.
