Description: Includes multiple methods to perform time-dependent matching with discrete and continuous time,
    allowing treatment and covariate changes at arbitrary case-specific timings.
	Among the included methods are balanced risk set matching, time-dependent propensity score matching,
	time-dependent prognostic score matching and time-dependent double score matching. Additionally includes various
	functions to create and transform start-stop data, because that is the required input for the matching.
	The package is designed specifically to handle very large datasets.
