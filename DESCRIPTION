Description: Includes multiple methods to perform time-dependent matching with discrete and continuous time,
    allowing treatment and covariate changes at arbitrary case-specific timings. Additionally includes various
	functions to create and transform start-stop data, because that is the required input for the matching.
	The package is designed specifically to handle very large datasets.
